![C Logo](https://img.icons8.com/color/452/c-programming.png)

This project focuses on the use of file I/O functions in the C programming language. It includes various tasks that involve reading and writing files, as well as working with file descriptors and file permissions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- The basics of file I/O operations in C
- File descriptors and their significance
- How to use the `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write` system calls
- How to manipulate file permissions when creating files
- The difference between system calls and library functions
- Proper handling of errors during file I/O operations

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files must end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory
- Code must follow the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Global variables are not allowed
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- Use of only the C standard library functions `malloc`, `free`, and `exit` is allowed. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., are forbidden
- Allowed syscalls: `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`
- The header file `main.h` must include prototypes for all functions and `_putchar`
