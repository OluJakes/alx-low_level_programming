# 0x10. C - Variadic Functions

This project explores the concept of variadic functions in C programming. Variadic functions allow you to create functions that can accept a variable number of arguments, providing great flexibility in the number of inputs they can handle.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what variadic functions are and how they work.
- Utilize the `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` macros to handle variadic arguments.
- Comprehend the purpose and usage of the `const` type qualifier.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should follow the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Only `malloc`, `free`, and `exit` functions from the C standard library are allowed. Other functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc. are forbidden.
- The following macros are allowed: `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`.
- The function `_putchar` is allowed, but you don't have to push `_putchar.c`.
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in the header file `variadic_functions.h`.
- All header files should be include guarded.

Remember that plagiarism is strictly forbidden, and any form of it will result in removal from the program.

## Project Files

This project will contain several files to demonstrate the usage of variadic functions and meet the learning objectives. The functions will be tested using custom `main.c` files provided by the checker. The header file `variadic_functions.h` will contain the prototypes for all the functions used in the project. Each function will be implemented in a separate file, ensuring modularity and readability.

The project will be submitted on time and adhere to the requirements outlined in this README.md file.
